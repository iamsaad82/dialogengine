You come to Germany to study? Welcome! A lot of things will be different for you here. To prepare you to study successfully, we will take care of your health insurance. As you might know, you may not enrol in Germany without a health insurance.

## How does the German health and welfare system work?

Health insuranceNursing care insuranceAccident insurance

### Health insurance in Germany

In Germany, health insurance is mandatory for all students. Please inform your health insurance provider early for which university or college you’re enrolling, in order to provide proof of health insurance. The health insurance company then transmits the necessary data on your insurance status to the educational institution.

### Nursing care insurance in Germany

Additional nursing care contributions are compulsory in Germany. The aim of nursing care insurance is to cover the risk of the need for care which may arise following a serious accident, illness or in old age. You take out nursing care insurance with the same organisation that provides your health insurance.

### Accident insurance in Germany

As a student, you are covered by a statutory accident insurance scheme on the premises of the college or university and on your way between home and college. You can obtain information on additional accident insurance from the Foreign Student Office. If you are on a scholarship or funding programme, please refer to the agreed rules and arrangements.

## As an international student, do I need to take out health insurance?

In Germany, all students have to provide proof of health and long-term care insurance by certificate of a statutory health insurance company, in order to be matriculated.

A student can be insured as follows:

- under statutory health insurance
- under student health insurance
- under private health insurance (an exemption from student health insurance is necessary)

If you are from another EU country and studying in Germany, you don't have to take out health insurance, under the condition that you are already insured in your home country and you can provide a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). If you are insured through private family insurance an exemption has to be individually reviewed.

This also applies to you, if your home country has signed a Social Security Agreement concerning health insurance with Germany. To verify your insurance to us, you need a certificate of entitlement (EESSI or  A/T 11).

Your AOK student advisor will personally discuss the best option for your particular situation with you:

With an European Health Insurance CardWith a social security agreementFrom non-EU states with no social security agreement

#### Students with an European Health Insurance Card

Students with a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) are also considered to possess a recognized health insurance in Germany.

Germany recognizes the EHIC’s of the following countries: Austria, Belgium Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus (southern), Czech Republik, Denmark (including the Faroe Islands and Greenland), Estonia, Finland, France (including Martinique and  Guadeloupe), Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal (including Madeira), Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain (including Balearic Islands and Canary Islands),Sweden and Switzerland

If you are planning to study in Germany and are originally from the UK you do not have access to the EHIC. Please inform the NHS that you are planning to study in Germany and registers for a Global Health Insurance Card under the following link: [https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/ "External link - The page NHS opens in a new window.")

To be able to enroll at a German university, you will need to prove that you have taken out a health insurance. You may do this by simply taking your EHIC or proof of insurance to a branch of the AOK. The AOK will then notify the University of your insurance status and transfer all relevant data for you.

#### Health insurance for students with a social security agreement

Citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey and Tunisia do not have an EHIC insurance card. However, these countries do have a bilateral social security agreement with the European Union. Would you like to study in Germany? If so, you must obtain an ‘entitlement document’ from your home health insurance provider before you leave. Take this form to a statutory health insurance provider in Germany, such as AOK, and they will give you an insurance certificate, which you can use to enrol at your university.

Citizens of Morocco are unfortunately not included in this agreement and must register for student health insurance at a German health care provider to be able to claim all benefits.

#### Health insurance for students from non-EU states with no social security agreement

If you come from a country that was not mentioned above and would like to study in Germany, you will need to take out insurance with a private or statutory provider, such as AOK.

## What do I need to bear in mind if I have a job alongside my studies?

Attention: The following rules only apply to Persons who have student health insurance with the AOK.

- All kinds of 'minor employment' up to an income threshold of 538 Euro/month are exempt from insurance in all lines of insurance.
- Short-term jobs up to a maximum of three months or 70 calendar days are exempt from insurance in all lines of insurance.
- During the semester, jobs that require you to work up to 20 hours a week are exempt from insurance under statutory health insurance, private health insurance and unemployment insurance.
- Regardless of how much money you earn and how many hours you work per week, as a student your job is exempt from insurance during semester breaks.

If you are insured with a different health care provider, please check which guidelines apply to you.

They pay out for treatment by doctors and dentists, medication, therapy (massages, physiotherapy, etc.), assistive equipment (wheelchairs, walking aids, etc.) and hospital treatment. You are also eligible to an allowance if you fall ill and are not able work. Please note that you are not eligible for this sickness allowance if you have student health insurance.
